Business decision: The result has to be analyzed deeply to understand people preference and the reasons. Study the past performance, commitments honored, image of the leaders etc, and the election manifesto. Based on these we can look at understanding current issues faced by people and include them in the manifesto, clean up past image if any were bad.
