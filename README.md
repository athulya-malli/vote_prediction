# Project: Election Poll Result Prediction and recommendations to increase winning chances

Analysis: Concepts of naïve bayes, KNN etc., were used to build model to predict voters’ choice of Party, and outcome of the result. The pattern was based on survey information conducted among a set of people, analyze data to predict the overall win and seats covered.

Outcome: Labour party is performing better than the conservative party with a huge difference in the margins, therefore much higher probability of winning for Labour party

Business decision: The result has to be analyzed deeply to understand people preference and the reasons. Study the past performance, commitments honored, image of the leaders etc, and the election manifesto. Based on these we can look at understanding current issues faced by people and include them in the manifesto, clean up past image if any were bad.
